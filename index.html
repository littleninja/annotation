        <div data-antn="question-1-annotation">What kind of nonfiction writing often begins by stating the date and location
            of an event?
        </div>
        <a href="#" data-antn="question-1-inline">On the 25th March, 18—, a very strange occurrence took place in St
            Petersburg.
        </a>
    On the Ascension Avenue there lived a barber of the name of Ivan Jakovlevitch. He had lost his family name, and on
    his sign-board, on which was depicted the head of a gentleman with one cheek soaped, the only inscription to be read
    was, "Blood-letting done here."
    </p>
    <p data-antn="paragraph">
        <div data-antn="question-2-annotation">Jakovlevitch sits up in bed and sees his wife working by the oven. From this
        description, what can you guess about the size of his apartment? Do you think he is wealthy, poor, or somewhere
        in between?
        </div>
        <a href="#" data-antn="question-2-inline">On this particular morning he awoke pretty early. Becoming aware of the
            smell of fresh-baked bread, he sat up a little in bed, and saw his wife, who had a special partiality for
            coffee, in the act of taking some fresh-baked bread out of the oven.
        </a>
    </p>
    <p data-antn="paragraph">"Today, Prasskovna Ossipovna," he said, "I do not want any coffee; I should like a fresh
        loaf with onions."
    </p>

    <p data-antn="paragraph">
        <div data-antn="question-3-annotation">From what you've read so far, how would you describe the relationship between
        Jakovlevitch and his wife?
        </div>
        <a href="#" data-antn="question-3-inline">"The blockhead may eat bread only as far as I am concerned," said his wife
            to herself; "then I shall have a chance of getting some coffee." And she threw a loaf on the table.
        </a>
    </p>
    <p data-antn="paragraph">For the sake of propriety, Ivan Jakovlevitch drew a coat over his shirt, sat down at the
        table, shook out some salt for himself, prepared two onions, assumed a serious expression, and began to cut the
        bread. After he had cut the loaf in two halves, he looked, and to his great astonishment saw something whitish
        sticking in it. He carefully poked round it with his knife, and felt it with his finger.
    </p>

    <p data-antn="paragraph">
        "Quite firmly fixed!" he murmured in his beard. "What can it be?"
    </p>

    <p data-antn="paragraph">
        He put in his finger, and drew out — a nose!
    </p>
